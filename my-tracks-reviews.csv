3426,"just ok.	like most of these apps this one does a good job at tracking your path and distance when you're out exercising and lets you choose between several types of activity.   what i don't like about this one is mostly the voice prompts. it sounds very synthetic and it shouldn't have to. it sounds like an out of breath asthmatic doctors office assistant making announcements over a poorly done speaker system. it is horrible. there is zero pause between words and sentences it is just a continuous stream of words and numbers. of course you can turn it off but i do prefer to get voice updates at regular intervals to see how i'm doing...   one other thing worth mentioning is that you select the activity type _after_ you've completed the activity and not before which i find counter-intuitive but as long as you're aware of it then you won't have to hunt around for that option before you get started.   i don't find the sharing options very useful it just allow you to upload your recorded track to google drive and then you can share that file with others.","		cid-gp:aoqptogrznk6vvtjw_lovl50ycpgfd6g1majlbfeyfay6qvtijruqwh-fvrtfvdvqgvz0-nedxpxcvne6agrew","		thu may 09 01:37:25 nzst 2013",3,9/05/2013 1:37,Good,
